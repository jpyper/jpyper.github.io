        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p class="page-meta">Published on: 2025-06-09</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my new little website. It is a new learning process for me.</p>
<p>My intentions for this site is to not only learn how to work with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, plus its more
modern flavors and a Static Site Generator (SSG) like <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, but to also maintain this site
with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, setup some kind of automated job to push any changes to my <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> repository so that
they show up in the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and become a part of this conglomeration of bits and bobs that I call home now.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the <a href="/wiki/">wiki</a> section. I will be posting things there that I have written down or copied into a notes app that I
think are useful. There I will be sharing those things with you.</p>
<p>I am still learning and how all of this flows together, so things could possibly break or not look right at times.</p>
<p>Check back on this blog once in a while and I will have updates of what is going on with me.</p>
